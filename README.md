# CircuitPython GC9A01 demos

Demos showing how to use [CircuitPython displayio driver](https://github.com/tylercrumpton/CircuitPython_GC9A01) for GC9A01-based round LCDs.  This driver is available in the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle), or you can install it by hand by copying the `gc9a01.py` file to your `CIRCUITPY/lib` directory, or use `circup install gc9a01`.

## Usage

```py
import board
import busio
import fourwire
import displayio
import gc9a01
displayio.release_displays()
# Raspberry Pi Pico pinout, one possibility, at "southwest" of board
tft_clk = board.GP10 # must be a SPI CLK
tft_mosi= board.GP11 # must be a SPI TX
tft_rst = board.GP12
tft_dc  = board.GP13
tft_cs  = board.GP14  # optional, can be "None"
tft_bl  = board.GP15  # optional, can be "None"
spi = busio.SPI(clock=tft_clk, MOSI=tft_mosi)
display_bus = fourwire.FourWire(spi, command=tft_dc, chip_select=tft_cs, reset=tft_rst)
display = gc9a01.GC9A01(display_bus, width=240, height=240, backlight_pin=tft_bl)

# ... normal circuitpython displayio stuff
```

## Installation

Each of the .py files in "examples" is its own demo. Copy one of these to be your CIRCUITPY's "code.py", like:
```
cp gc9a01_hellocircles.py /Volumes/CIRCUITPY/code.py
```

You'll need to install various libraries.  Most notably the `gc9a01` library. You may also
need the `adafruit_display_text` and `adafruit_imageload`, depending on the example.
The easiest way to install these is from a terminal:
```
circup install gc9a01
circup install adafruit_display_text
circup install adafruit_imageload
```


## Examples

Check out the 'examples' directory for complete examples:

- 'gc9a01_helloworld' -- shows one way of doing polar coordinates
- 'gc9a01_hellocircles' -- similar to above but with floating circles using `vectorio`
- 'gc9a01_picture_locket' -- display a series of pictures, makes a nice locket if used with a QT Py Haxpress
- 'gc9a01_gauge_knob' -- round dial gauge using gauge background & dial bitmaps, showing `bitmaptools.rotozoom`

The examples attempt to auto-detect the board you're using. The currently detected boards:

- [QT Py M0 Haxpress](https://circuitpython.org/board/qtpy_m0_haxpress/)
- [QT Py RP2040](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_rp2040/)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)
- [ItsyBitsy M4 Express](https://circuitpython.org/board/itsybitsy_m4_express/)

### Eyeballs demos

Additionally, there are several demos in the "examples/eyeballs" directory that use these round displays to make moving eyes.

- 'eyeballs/qteye.py' -- single eyeball (or two eyeballs wired in parallel) on a QT PY RP2040 or similar
- 'eyeballs/qtpy_person_sensor.py' -- single eyeball that tracks your face, thanks to a Person Sensor module
- 'eyeballs/gc9a01_lizard_eye.py' -- similar to "qteye" but uses a cool lizard eye (thx @DJDevon3!)
- 'eyeballs/gc9a01_multi_eyeball.py' -- independent multiple eyes usigng a [recompiled CircuitPython](https://todbot.com/blog/2022/05/19/multiple-displays-in-circuitpython-compiling-custom-circuitpython/)


## Wiring

Wiring is dependent on board you're hooking it up to. The "SCL" and "SDA" lines need to be
hooked up to SPI pins "SCK" and "MOSI/TX". The `gc9a01_helloworld.py` has example wirings for three
different boards.  Here is an example for the Pico:

- VCC - Pico 3.3V(out)
- Gnd - Pico Ground
- SCL - Pico GP10 (SPI1 SCK)
- SDA - Pico GP11 (SPI1 TX)
- RES - Pico GP12
- DC  - Pico GP13
- CS  - Pico GP14
- BLK - Pico GP15 (can be omitted if you don't need backlight brightness control)

Here is an example for a QT Py Haxpress:

- VCC - QT Py 3.3V
- Gnd - QT Py Ground
- SCL - QT Py SCK
- SDA - QT Py MO
- RES - QT Py TX
- DC  - QT Py A3
- CS  - QT Py A2
- BLK - unconnected

## Building your own dial gauges

There is a partial Python port of [@bikerglen's gauge-generator](https://github.com/bikerglen/round-lcd-gauges/tree/main/gauge-generator) in [`docs/gauge-generator`](./docs/gauge-generator). These scripts use the wonderful [Wand](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.6/) Python wrapper for ImageMagick's C API.


## Future Project Ideas:
- bargraph display using vectorio



### Notes to self:

- This repo started out as a GC9A01 driver for CircuitPython, but [@tylercrumpton](https://github.com/tylercrumpton/CircuitPython_GC9A01) beat me to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle) by a few days. Now it's a repo of demos
